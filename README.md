### Inital design thoughts

As this website is for mental health awareness, I wanted to create a simple flowing webpage that was brought a calming experience to the user with out being overloading to the user. I felt the colour plate used was extremely important as it sets the tone of the webpage

#### Colour pallet

I wanted to use a colour pallette that kept inline with the clean and supportive experience. For that reason I wanted to use a green pallette as that often promote the feelings of renewal, tranquility, growth, and inspiration.

#### Typography

Playfair Display - used for headers as its a stylish serif font that aligns with my concepts of bring a calming experience to the user.

Roboto - used for main bodies of text as it is simple and highly readable emphasising the ease of use. 

Font awesome for any icons used.
