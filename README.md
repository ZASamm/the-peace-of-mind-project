### Inital design thoughts

As this website is for mental health awareness, I wanted to create a simple flowing webpage that was brought a calming experience to the user with out being overloading to the user. I felt the colour plate used was extremly important as it sets the tone of the webpage

#### Colour pallet
- Seafoam Green (#C1E7E3): Evokes a refreshing, natural vibe.
- Light Peach (#FFDACC): Gentle warmth that feels supportive.
- Powder Blue (#E7EFF6): Adds a calming and clean feel.
- Light Sand (#F4F1DE): For a soft, neutral background.
- Slate Grey (#6D7278): For bold text and headers without being harsh.

#### Typography

Playfair Display - used for headers as its a stylish serif font that aligns with my concepts of bring a calming experience to the user.

Roboto - used for main bodys of text as it is simple and highly readable emphasising the ease of use. 

Font awesome for any icons used.
